A multiple path story

## Explanation

This project is the last exercise from the appbrewery flutter course.
It's a multiple choice story teller with a taste for mistery and crime.

You may run it by installing flutter on your machine and running the app on your desktop.
You can also run it on your phone or on a Apple / Android phone emulator.
